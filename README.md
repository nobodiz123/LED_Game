# LED_Game
I was feeling a little bored and had a lot of free time on my hands especially during this digital learning semester. So, I started messing around with an Arduino Uno that I had to make a simple and engaging LED game. The goal of the game was to click on a button whenever the green LED turned on. Each successful attempt, the delay between the alternating LED’s would reduce until eventually you had “won”. 

 After my first few attempts, the game seemed a little easy to beat. So, I juiced up my code a little bit and added different, more randomized patterns to keep the player on their feet.
